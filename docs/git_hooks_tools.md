## git hooks tools

Manages script folders for tools.

### Synopsis

Manages script folders for tools.

Currently the following tools are supported:

#### Dialog Tool (`<toolName>` = `dialog`)

The interface of the dialog tool is as follows:

If `run` is executable, then the following is executed

```shell
$ run <title> <text> <options> <long-options>...
```

otherwise, assuming `run` is a shell script, the following is executed

```shell
$ sh run <title> <text> <options> <long-options>...
```

The arguments of the dialog tool are:

- `<title>` is the title for the GUI dialog
- `<text>` is the text for the GUI dialog
- `<short-options>` are the button return values, slash-delimited,
  e.g. `Y/n/d`. The default button is the first capital character found.
- `<long-options>...` are the button texts in the GUI,
  e.g. `Yes`, `no`, `disable`.

The script needs to return one of the short-options on `stdout`.
Non-zero exit code triggers the fallback of reading from `stdin`.

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for tools
```
