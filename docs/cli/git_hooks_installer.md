                                       defined by a search path.
      --prefix string                  Githooks installation prefix such that
                                       `<prefix>/.githooks` will be the installation directory.
      --template-dir string            The preferred template directory to use.
      --maintained-hooks stringArray   A set of hook names which are maintained
                                       Any argument can be a hook name `<hookName>`, `all` or `server`.
                                       An optional prefix '!' means subtraction from the current set.
                                       The initial value of the internally built set defaults
                                       to all hook names if `all` or `server` is not given as first argument:
                                         - `all` : All hooks supported by Githooks.
                                         - `server` : All server hooks supported by Githooks.

                                       and install/update itself. Githooks tries to
                                       auto-detect the deploy setting for downloading binaries.
                                       You can however provide a deploy settings file yourself if
                                       the auto-detection does not work (see `--deploy-settings`).
      --clone-branch string            The clone branch from which Githooks should
                                       clone and install/update itself.
      --deploy-api string              The deploy api type (e.g. [`gitea`, `github`]) to use for updates
                                       of the specified `clone-url` for helping the deploy settings
                                       auto-detection. For Github urls, this is not needed.
      --deploy-settings string         The deploy settings YAML file to use for updates of the specified
                                       `--clone-url`. See the documentation for further details.
      --build-from-source              If the binaries are built from source instead of
                                       downloaded from the deploy url.
      --build-tags stringArray         Build tags for building from source (get extended with defaults).
      --use-pre-release                When fetching the latest installer, also consider pre-release versions.
