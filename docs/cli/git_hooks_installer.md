## git hooks installer

Githooks installer application.

### Synopsis

Githooks installer application.
It downloads the Githooks artifacts of the current version
from a deploy source and verifies its checksums and signature.
Then it calls the installer on the new version which
will then run the installation procedure for Githooks.

      --non-interactive              Run the installation non-interactively
                                     without showing prompts.
      --update                       Install and update directly to the latest
                                     possible tag on the clone branch.
      --skip-install-into-existing   Skip installation into existing repositories
                                     defined by a search path.
      --prefix string                Githooks installation prefix such that
                                     `<prefix>/.githooks` will be the installation directory.
      --template-dir string          The preferred template directory to use.
      --maintained-hooks strings     A set of hook names which are maintained in the template directory.
                                     Any argument can be a hook name `<hookName>`, `all` or `server`.
                                     An optional prefix '!' means subtraction from the current set.
                                     The initial value of the internally built set defaults
                                     to all hook names if `all` or `server` is not given as first argument:
                                       - `all` : All hooks supported by Githooks.
                                       - `server` : Only server hooks supported by Githooks.
                                     You can list them separately or comma-separated in one argument.
      --use-core-hookspath           If the install mode `core.hooksPath` should be used.
      --use-manual                   If the install mode `manual` should be used.
      --use-template-dir             If the install mode `init.templateDir` should be used.
                                     If no mode given, this is the default.
      --clone-url string             The clone url from which Githooks should clone
                                     and install/update itself. Githooks tries to
                                     auto-detect the deploy setting for downloading binaries.
                                     You can however provide a deploy settings file yourself if
                                     the auto-detection does not work (see `--deploy-settings`).
      --clone-branch string          The clone branch from which Githooks should
                                     clone and install/update itself.
      --deploy-api string            The deploy api type (e.g. [`gitea`, `github`]) to use for updates
                                     of the specified `clone-url` for helping the deploy settings
                                     auto-detection. For Github urls, this is not needed.
      --deploy-settings string       The deploy settings YAML file to use for updates of the specified
                                     `--clone-url`. See the documentation for further details.
      --build-from-source            If the binaries are built from source instead of
                                     downloaded from the deploy url.
      --build-tags strings           Build tags for building from source (get extended with defaults).
                                     You can list them separately or comma-separated in one argument.
      --use-pre-release              When fetching the latest installer, also consider pre-release versions.
  -h, --help                         help for installer
