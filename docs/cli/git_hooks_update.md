## git hooks update

Performs an update check.

### Synopsis

Executes an update check for a newer Githooks version.

If it finds one and the user accepts the prompt (or `--yes` is used)
the installer is executed to update to the latest version.

The `--enable-ckeck` and `--disable-ckeck` options enable or disable
the automatic checks that would normally run daily
after a successful commit event.

```
git hooks update
```
