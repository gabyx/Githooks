## git hooks list

Lists the active hooks in the current repository.

### Synopsis

Lists the active hooks in the current repository along with their state.
This command needs to be run at the root of a repository.

If `type` is given, then it only lists the hooks for that trigger event.
The supported hooks are:

- `applypatch-msg`
- `pre-applypatch`
- `post-applypatch`
- `pre-commit`
- `pre-merge-commit`
- `prepare-commit-msg`
- `commit-msg`
- `post-commit`
- `pre-rebase`
- `post-checkout`
- `post-merge`
- `pre-push`
- `pre-receive`
- `update`
- `post-receive`
- `post-update`
- `reference-transaction`
- `push-to-checkout`
- `pre-auto-gc`
- `post-rewrite`
- `sendemail-validate`
- `post-index-change`

The value `ns-path` is the namespaced path which is used for the ignore patterns.
